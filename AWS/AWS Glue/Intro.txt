Managed ETL
Serverless - point it at ETL jobs and press 'run'
Crawlers with schema inference. Discover datasets, filetypes, schema. Stored in centralised metadata catalogue
Generates scripts needed to ETL from source to target.

e.g. Data in semi structured format in JSON in S3, and more data in RDS. Then move it into a redshift database.
Point crawlers at the RDS and S3. They will figure out the schemas etc. and store it as tables in the data catalogue.
Then point Glue at those metadata tables, which will auto generate the scripts to flatten the data.

Graph based user interface in console for editing scripts, or just write them.
