//Overview//

Snowflake is a 'database as a service' - a cloud based data warehouse (DW) aiming to take advantage of the flexibility, scalabilty, and avilability offered by cloud platforms.

The advantages of the cloud can only be leveraged if the underlying software is designed to scale elastically over a pool of resources. In cotrast, pre-cloud DWs are designed to run on small, static clusters. 

The nature of data has also changed. Previously, most data collected would come from business systems (CRM, ERP etc.) in a well-defined structure and volume. Today, a large share of data is from sources such as logs, web aps, social media, IoT etc. which are unpredictable in their volume and schema. Traditional DWs rely on fine-tuned data pipelines that rely on predictable data, and are therefore struggling with the shifting nature of data. Business have turned to big-data tools such as Hadoop, but these do not have the advantages of establish DW technology.

Snowflake is built from the ground up to tackle both of these issues. The core features of Snowflake are:

Database-as-a-service
	Removes the requirement of users to set up the system on machines. 
	Data must be landed in the cloud and aims for the data to be immediately queryable via the Snowflake UI or satndard protocols such as ODBC. 
Relational
	Snowlfake supports ANSI SQL and ACID transactions.
Semi-Structured
	Snowflake has built-in functions for traversing, flattening, and nesting semi-structured data.
	It supports popular formats (e.g. JSON, Avro) out of the box.
	Snowflake runs automatic schema discovery and stores data as columns, making queries over semi-structured data almost as fast as over relational data.
Elastic
	Storage and compute can be scaled dynamically without affecting availability or running queries.
Highly Available
	Snowflake tolerates full datacener failures. No downtime during upgrades.
Durable
	Snowflake uses cloning, undrop, and cross-region backups to provide data durability.
Cost-Efficient
	Snowflake aims to be compute-efficient.
	All table data is compressed.
	Users pay only for what storage and compute resources they actually use.
Secure
	All data including temporary files and network traffic is encrypted end-to-end.
	No user data is exposed to the cloud platform.
	Implements role-based access control.
