Full cloud data platform, built from the ground up
SAAS
Both structured and semi-structured
ANCI SQL Compliant
Self tuning and healing 
Don't deal with partitioning and vacuuming etc
AWS, Azure, GCP
Pay for what you use
Live and secure data sharing

OLAP System - Online Analytical Process
Not for OLTP - Online Transaction Processing

One single storage location for all data, so no silo'ed data marts
One copy of data, supporting multiple workloads
Unlimited performance and scale
Secure and governed access to all service
near zero maintenance

compute scalable on the fly

Three layers
Services - infra manager, optimiser, metadata manager, security
Multi cluster compute - virtual warehouse running queries
Centralised storage - where data is stored
then cloud agnostic layer as interface to big 3 cloud

Snowflake deploys into a VPC (or other cloud equivalent) managed by Snowflake

JDBC / ODBC connectors and more, python go etc.

configure each warehouse differently if we want
can read and write simultaneously

Increase size of warehouse to deal with heavier workflows
Increase number of warehouses (multi cluster) to deal with many workflows concurrently

Clone without duplicating storage
